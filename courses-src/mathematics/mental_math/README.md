## Mental Math

The goal of this course is to give help learners to develop the following skills

1. Rapid Mental Basic Arithmatic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
2. Tools for doing mental math in a robust way: i.e. Left-to-Right Method.
3. Shortcut Methods for rapid computation of various arithmetic operations.
4. Approaches for dealing with fractions, percentages and larger numbers.

For each method or exercise I want to show 2 things, first a proof using traditional methods
that the answer is correct and secondly, showing why the answer is correct i.e. providing some visual, symbolic
or textual intuition as to why the method works.
