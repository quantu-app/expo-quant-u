description: |
  Herein we discuss various general methods for doing arithmetic calculations. The general idea is that we try
  to transform a difficult sequence of operations on numbers into an equivalent sequence that or structure that is then
  much easier for humans to compute. We also examine ways to approximate and roughly guess results. Finally, we learn
  methods for quickly checking the correctness of mental computations.
